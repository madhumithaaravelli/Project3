# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

As members, contributors, and leaders, we vow to create a community where everyone can participate without experiencing harassment, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We commit to conducting ourselves in a manner that fosters an atmosphere of openness, inclusivity, diversity, and overall community health.

## Our Standards

Following are examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment for our
community:

* Displaying compassion and understanding for others
* Respecting and valuing the perspectives, experiences, and opinions of others
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The utilization of sexualized language or imagery, as well as any form of sexual attention or advances.
- Launching personal or political assaults, trolling, and making offensive or disparaging remarks.
- Engaging in harassment, either in public or privately.
- Revealing others' private information, such as physical or email addresses, without their explicit consent.
- Any other behavior that could reasonably be deemed inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders bear the responsibility of elucidating and upholding our standards of acceptable behavior. They will judiciously undertake corrective action that is both appropriate and fair in response to any behavior perceived as inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders possess the authority and duty to eliminate, modify, or decline comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that deviate from this Code of Conduct. They will communicate the rationale behind moderation decisions when deemed appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies universally across all community spaces, encompassing situations where an individual formally represents the community in public domains. Examples of such representation comprise the use of an official email address, sharing content via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative in online or offline events.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will decide the repercussions for any behavior they believe to be against 
this code of conduct by consulting these Community Impact Guidelines:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Engaging in the use of inappropriate language or displaying behavior that is considered unprofessional or unwelcome within the community is not acceptable.

**Consequence**: Community leaders have the authority to send the offending person a confidential, written warning in the case of a violation. Clarity regarding the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the activity was deemed inappropriate are the goals of this communication. A public apology could also be requested as a part of the resolution procedure.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation can occur through either a singular incident or a sequence of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning accompanied by consequences for persistent behavior. During a specified period, individuals are required to refrain from any interaction with those involved, including unsolicited contact with those responsible for enforcing the Code of Conduct. This restriction encompasses abstaining from interactions in community spaces and external channels such as social media. Failure to comply with these terms may result in a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards involves persistent inappropriate behavior that significantly deviates from the established norms and expectations within the community.

**Consequence**: For an established amount of time, any kind of public engagement or communication with the community is prohibited under a temporary ban. People are not allowed to connect with persons involved in any way, either in public or privately, during this time. This includes not contacting those who are in charge of enforcing the Code of Conduct without permission. There could be a permanent ban for breaking these rules.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards involves consistently engaging in inappropriate behavior, harassment of individuals, or displaying aggression toward, and disparagement of, classes of individuals over an extended period.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban entails a complete and enduring restriction from any form of public interaction within the community.
